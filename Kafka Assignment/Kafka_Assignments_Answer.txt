a.) Use "group.id" property in consumer config for both consumers and mention different group_ids in kafka_consumer_1.py & kafka_consumer_2.py,
        apply "earliest" offset property in both consumers and run these two consumers from two different terminals. Calculate how many records each consumer
        consumed and printed on the terminal

ANS - consumer1 read --> 12758
      consumer2 read --> 12826

b.) Use "group.id" property in consumer config for both consumers and mention same group_ids in kafka_consumer_1.py & kafka_consumer_2.py,
        apply "earliest" offset property in both consumers and run these two consumers from two different terminals. Calculate how many records each consumer
        consumed and printed on the terminal

ANS - consumer1 read --> 4239
      consumer2 read --> 8587
      total messages both read --> 12826

c. ) Once above questions are done, write another kafka consumer to read data from kafka topic and from the consumer code create one csv file "output.csv"
      and append consumed records output.csv file
